# Welcome
This aime of this tutorial is to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll website. We’ll cover topics such as getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content like posts, downloads, documentations and many more. And customizing the way this site works and looks, deploying to various environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future development of Jekyll itself.

# So what is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

# How can I create a new post? 

We will create a post in the _posts folder. As we can see, there are 3 folders in _posts folder. 

If we create a new file in any of the folders, which are categories, with required lines, will published in the main page.
